    Welcome to recovery boot console,

the root partition as specified in cmdline.txt is now mounted under /rootfs
boot partition is mounted under /boot and bond to /rootfs/boot as well. 
the same applies for /proc, /sys, /dev and /run. you can chroot into your 
installation with 'chroot /rootfs'. this will allow you work with you're 
xbian installation almost like in full booted mode (restricted to text console)
with effective uid=0 (root).

network can be started with 'ipconfig eth0' for dhcp mode, 
or 'ipconfig ip=ip:mask:gw:::eth0' for static address (where 
[ip] is you ip address, [mask] is your network mask and [gw] 
is ip address of your gateway (router).

after you finish your work, exit from chroot with 'exit' and then 
exit again from recovery console shell. your boot will continue.

in this environment, three aliases are already predefined. just run:

'reb' to run 'umount -a; sync; reboot -fn'
        (unmounts all filesystems, sync writes and reboot)
'rum' to run 'umount -a'
'rch' to run 'chroot $CONFIG_newroot'
